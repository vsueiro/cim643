# The ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù is a *very* tangible thing

## Humble beginnings

### At [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web)
- The [first web server](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/First_Web_Server.jpg) ever
- The [first website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) ever

### At [Google]()
- Google‚Äôs first 40 GB storage uni with [coolers & LEGO bricks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/The_first_Google_computer_at_Stanford.jpg)
- Google‚Äôs first [web server](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Google%E2%80%99s_First_Production_Server.jpg)

## IPs & DNS
- https://142.250.219.14/ (this link will probably stop working soon)
- Type `google.com` [here](https://domaintoipconverter.com/) to get the new IP
- Enter an IP on [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to know its geographic location

## Alternatives to the ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù
- Self hosting on a personal computer ‚Äì maybe a tiny one, like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/)
- A [solar-powered website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) (which goes offline during bad [weather](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/solar_panel007.png))

## Alternatives to worrying about a server
- [CodeSanbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- ‚Ä¶

## Building a personal site

We‚Äôll live code a simple website (using HTML & CSS) with this content:

```
Hello! üëã 

My name is Vinicius Sueiro and I‚Äôm a
designer that codes things for the web.

Check my projects on Instagram
and reach out to me on Twitter
for freelance.

Let‚Äôs make magic. ü¶Ñ
