# Ideas for Project 3 (Dynamic Website)

Your goal is to explore a third-party API or library.

## But… What do we mean by “dynamic”?

We are *streching* the definition of dynamic  – which usually means to have a database connected to your website. Here, it accounts for projects that request data from third-party APIs, as well as highly interactive websites.

Think of it as a website that changes it’s content depending on:

- **Who** is viewing it;
- **When** people are viewing it;
- **Where** they are located;
- **What** they type in; or
- **How** they interact with your website

Too vague? Here are a few project ideas to get you inspired:

## Sample projects ideas

### Utilitarian

- A currency converter, using [Freecurrency](https://freecurrencyapi.com/) API
- A to-do list, using [Web Storage](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp) API or [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/) API
- A showcase of NASA’s picture of the day posted on the user’s birthday, [NASA’s APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/) API

### Artistic

- A generative artwork that changes based on time of the day, using [P5](https://p5js.org/) library
- A collaborative drawing that gets reset every day, using [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/) API
- A geometric 3D background for your portfolio, using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library

### Mini games

- A point-and-click mistery game, using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) library
- A “guess the movie” game, using [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/) API
- A “guess the country” game, using [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) API

These are just suggestions to get you started. I did not test the feasibility of any of those ideas.
