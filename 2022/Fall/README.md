### Resources & Materials for class

I will provide you with relevant readings digitally. You will need access to either the Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.) or the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel).

#### JavaScript for Web Designers

This is the only book you’ll need for the class. It’s a wonderful introduction to JavaScript concepts we’ll cover, and it’s not too pricey. You can order it directly from A Book Apart
or find it on Amazon. Please don’t buy the book until after our first lecture.

#### Codepen

We’ll be using Codepen to prototype and practice concepts quickly. You will be fine with just the free tier.

#### GitHub

We’ll be using GitHub to back up, share, and publish our code.

### Honor Code

There is an expectation that if you are attending a class live, you’ll be an active participant; the university believes an effective way of achieving this is by sharing your video feed during the class.

The University has provided the following language related to lecture recordings:

Students are expressly prohibited from recording any part of this course. Meetings of this course might be recorded by the University. Any recordings will be available to students registered for this class as they are intended to supplement the classroom experience.

Students are expected to follow appropriate University policies and maintain the security of passwords used to access recorded lectures. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments. If the instructor or a University of Miami office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use.
