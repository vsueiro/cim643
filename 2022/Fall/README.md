### Resources & Materials for class

I will provide you with relevant readings digitally. You will need access to either the Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.) or the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel).

#### JavaScript for Web Designers

This is the only book you’ll need for the class. It’s a wonderful introduction to JavaScript concepts we’ll cover, and it’s not too pricey. You can order it directly from A Book Apart
or find it on Amazon. Please don’t buy the book until after our first lecture.

#### Codepen

We’ll be using Codepen to prototype and practice concepts quickly. You will be fine with just the free tier.

#### GitHub

We’ll be using GitHub to back up, share, and publish our code.
