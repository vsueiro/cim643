## About the Course

This course focuses on job-ready skills and production workflow techniques in highest demand for front-end web developers. Students will learn, practice and demonstrate the skills and principles needed to make effective use of these technologies.

### Course Goals

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Materialize ideas as interactive websites
- Collaborate with development teams efficiently
- Apply computational thinking skills to other fields

### Course Topics

In order to reach the desired goals, students will learn concepts and techniques related to the 3 core technologies of the web (with an emphasis on the last one):

- 🧱 [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) (to define structure and content)
- 🎨 [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) (to apply visual styles)
- ✨ [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) (to create interactions)

This course also covers tools that help us organize and scale up our projects:

- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) (to write code without installing stuff)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Svelte](https://reactjs.org/) (to organize your website into components)

Optionally:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (to easily deploy your website)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (to write code as files in your own computer)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) (to collaborate with others – and your future self)
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) (to rent a friendly name, like “example.com”)

All tools are free (or provide a free version), except Google Domains. 💸

### Course Timeline

We will not learn everything at once. Instead, this course is split into a few steps. Each step builds on top of what we learned from the previous one. Here is what this progression looks like:

![Weekly gantt chart shows weeks class, divided into steps. It resembles 2D platform games by indicading a 🐥 character needs to progress to reach a 🔭 in the end.”](assets/cim643.png)

After a few of weeks of introduction, students begin working on projects (of increasing complexity).

#### Presentation week

At the end of each project step, we have **presentation week** – imagine this to be you a few times during the semester:

![Character with microphone](assets/presentation-week.png)

On presentation week, both classes of that week will be dedicated to presentation and discussion of projects. Half of the students present one day and half on the other. Each student has about 5 minutes to present their project and get feedback.

After the presentation, students are free to adjust the project (based on that feedback) and submit it for grading (prior to the beginning of the first class of the following week).

The following tables briefly describe what we will be doing during class (“Content”) and what you are expected to do before each class (“Preparation”).

## Office Hours

Students may schedule individual sessions with the instructor. Please use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/vsueiro/office-hours) to pick a specific time slot for our remote (Zoom) meeting. If you want to meet at another day or time, please email your instructor to check availability.

## Policies

<details>
    <summary>Religious Holy Day Policy</summary>
    It is the student’s obligation to provide faculty members with notice of the dates they will be absent for religious holy days. Students are responsible for material covered in class regardless of their presence. The University’s complete Religious Holy Day Policy can be found in the current Bulletin.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Attendance Policy</summary>
    Class attendance is critical to the success of hands-on classes, including class participation in discussions and completion of in-class assignments. All students are responsible for material covered in the classroom regardless of their presence; therefore, check the class Blackboard for announcements, assignment requirements and due dates. Do not email your instructor to find out what has been posted to Blackboard.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Recording Policy</summary>
    Students are expressly prohibited from recording any part of this course. If any recordings are available to students, they are intended to supplement the classroom experience. Students are expected to follow appropriate University policies and maintain the security of passwords used to access recorded lectures. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.

    If the instructor or a University of Miami office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use. Instructors are the copyright owner of the courseware; individual recordings of the materials on Blackboard and/or of the virtual sessions are not allowed; and that such materials cannot be shared outside the physical or virtual classroom environment.

### Honor Code & Plagiarism Statements

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the University of Miami Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework. Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated.

No honest student wants to be guilty of the intellectual crime of plagiarism, even unintentionally. Therefore, we provide you with these guidelines so that you don’t accidentally fall into the plagiarism trap.

Plagiarism is the taking of someone else’s words, work, or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Plagiarism may occur when a person fails to place quotation marks around someone else’s exact words, directly rephrasing or paraphrasing someone else’s words while still following the general form of the original, and/or failing to issue the proper citation to one’s source material.

In student papers, plagiarism is often due to:

- Turning in someone else’s paper as one’s own
- Using another person’s data or ideas without acknowledgment
- Failing to cite a written source (printed or internet) of information that you used to collect data or ideas
- Copying an author’s exact words and putting them in the paper without quotation marks
- Rephrasing an author’s words and failing to cite the source
- Copying, rephrasing, or quoting an author’s exact words and citing a source other than where the material was obtained
- Using wording that is very similar to that of the original source, but passing it off as one’s own

The last item is probably the most common problem in student writing. It is still plagiarism if students use an author’s key phrases or sentences in a way that implies they are their own, even if they cite the source.

### Well-Being Resources & Support

As you complete your coursework, consider how you can maintain your health and well-being as a top priority. To help you become familiar with the many programs and services available on campus, review the information collected on the Student Well-Being and Resiliency website available at [miami.edu/well-being](https://miami.edu/well-being).

Please reach out to me or any of the resources listed on the site if you need assistance or support throughout the semester.
